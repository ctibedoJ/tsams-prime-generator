Prime Indexed Möbius Transformation State Space Theory

A classical Python package for working with Prime Indexed Möbius Transformations,
State Space Theory, and Cyclotomic Field Applications as described in Chapters 16-22.

This package provides computational tools for:
- Cyclotomic fields and their properties
- Prime indexed Möbius transformations and the 420-root structure
- State space theory and transformation mechanics
- The 441-dimensional nodal structure
- Hair braid dynamics and braid invariants
- Hyperbolic priming transformations and energy quantization
